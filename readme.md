# NeoVim Configuration Repository

Welcome to this NeoVim configuration repository with a comprehensive set of configuration files. The objective is to create a NeoVim development environment to compare other IDEs and Text Editors, such as VS Code.

## Origin

Created this repository after watching Michael B. Paulson's YouTube video, [0 to LSP: Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE). If you're looking for more NeoVim configurations, check out ThePrimeagen's repo at [ThePrimeagen/init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua).

## Prerequisites

Before adopting these configuration files, please ensure that Neovim is installed on your system. Download it from the official [NeoVim Site](https://neovim.io/) or install it via a package manager, depending on your Operating System.

## Note

Please note that some configurations may be language-specific, and might need adjusting according to your personal needs and the programming languages you use.
